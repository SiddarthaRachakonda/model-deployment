# Mushroom App: Model Deployment Demo

In this tutorial we will deploy a model to Vertex AI:

## Prerequisites
* Have Docker installed
* Cloned this repository to your local machine with a terminal up and running
* Check that your Docker is running with the following command

`docker run hello-world`

### Install Docker 
Install `Docker Desktop`

#### Ensure Docker Memory
- To make sure we can run multiple container go to Docker>Preferences>Resources and in "Memory" make sure you have selected > 4GB

### Install VSCode  
Follow the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system.  
If you already have a preferred text editor, skip this step.  

## Setup Environments
In this tutorial we will setup a container to manage packaging python code for training and creating jobs on Vertex AI (AI Platform) to run training tasks.

**In order to complete this tutorial you will need your GCP account setup and a WandB account setup.**

### Clone the github repository
- Clone or download from [here](https://github.com/dlops-io/model-deployment)

### API's to enable in GCP for Project
Search for each of these in the GCP search bar and click enable to enable these API's
* Vertex AI API

### Setup GCP Credentials
Next step is to enable our container to have access to Storage buckets & Vertex AI(AI Platform) in  GCP. 

#### Create a local **secrets** folder

It is important to note that we do not want any secure information in Git. So we will manage these files outside of the git folder. At the same level as the `model-deployment` folder create a folder called **secrets**

Your folder structure should look like this:
```
   |-model-deployment
   |-secrets
```

#### Setup GCP Service Account
- Here are the step to create a service account:
- To setup a service account you will need to go to [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard), search for  "Service accounts" from the top search box. or go to: "IAM & Admins" > "Service accounts" from the top-left menu and create a new service account called "model-deployment". For "Service account permissions" select "Storage Admin", "AI Platform Admin", "Vertex AI Administrator".
- This will create a service account
- On the right "Actions" column click the vertical ... and select "Manage keys". A prompt for Create private key for "model-deployment" will appear select "JSON" and click create. This will download a Private key json file to your computer. Copy this json file into the **secrets** folder. Rename the json file to `model-deployment.json`

### Create GCS Bucket

We need a bucket to store the saved model files that we will be used by Vertext AI to deploy models.

- Go to `https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser`
- Create a bucket `mushroom-app-models-demo` [REPLACE WITH YOUR BUCKET NAME]

## Run Container

### Run `docker-shell.sh` or `docker-shell.bat`
Based on your OS, run the startup script to make building & running the container easy

This is what your `docker-shell` file will look like:
```
export IMAGE_NAME=model-deployment-cli
export BASE_DIR=$(pwd)
export SECRETS_DIR=$(pwd)/../secrets/
export GCP_PROJECT="ac215-project" [REPLACE WITH YOUR PROJECT]
export GCS_MODELS_BUCKET_NAME="mushroom-app-models-demo" [REPLACE WITH YOUR BUCKET NAME]


# Build the image based on the Dockerfile
#docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME -f Dockerfile .
# M1/2 chip macs use this line
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME --platform=linux/arm64/v8 -f Dockerfile .

# Run Container
docker run --rm --name $IMAGE_NAME -ti \
-v "$BASE_DIR":/app \
-v "$SECRETS_DIR":/secrets \
-e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/secrets/model-deployment.json \
-e GCP_PROJECT=$GCP_PROJECT \
-e GCS_MODELS_BUCKET_NAME=$GCS_MODELS_BUCKET_NAME \
$IMAGE_NAME
```

- Make sure you are inside the `model-deployment` folder and open a terminal at this location
- Run `sh docker-shell.sh` or `docker-shell.bat` for windows
